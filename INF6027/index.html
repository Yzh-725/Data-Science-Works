    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> This project is a data analysis exercise focusing on [UEFA Euro 2020].</p>
    
    <p><strong>Research Questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. [Which player behaviors (e.g., passes completed, shots on target,  tackles) are the most significant predictors of goals in individual matches?]</li>
        <li>2. [Which player behaviors significantly influence team success at the tournament level?]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding 1: [Combined with the results of match-level regression analysis, Attempts on Target, Passes Accuracy, Clearances Successful and other variables showed strong significance. This suggests that these actions have a significant impact on the number of goals scored in individual matches. Attempts on Target had the strongest positive coefficient of 0.45 (p<0.001). Attempts on target had the strongest positive coefficient of 0.45 (P <0.001). The positive correlation between Passes Accuracy and Clearances Successful (p<0.01) indicates that more efficient pass control can indirectly promote offensive opportunities, and robust defensive strategies can also help offensive play. Other variables such as Corners (F=3.9625), while not significant, may also be potentially valuable in race-specific dynamics.]</li>
        <li>Finding 2: [Combined with the results of the team-level regression analysis, at the Team level, some variables not mentioned in question 1 showed significance. Attempts on Target slightly decreased in importance at the tournament level (F=3.9605), while Delivery into the Penalty Area showed strong significance (coefficient: 0.04, p<0.05), which proves its importance in the overall tactic. Crosses Completed showed a negative effect, indicating that over-reliance on cross tactics may affect the overall performance of the team. Blocks also exhibit negative significance.]</li>
